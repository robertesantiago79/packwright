# Build State

- Current slice: S1.1 - Contract Hardening + Quality Fixes
- Status: ACCEPTANCE PASSED - AWAITING CONTROLLER GATE REVIEW
- Deviations:
  - A repository-local Git identity is used because no global Git identity is configured in Termux.
  - Slice 1 implementation deviations: None.
  - S1.1 implementation deviations: None.
- Pending forks:
  - Governance ratifications #2-#4 remain PENDING per controller instruction.
  - Full TypeScript-to-JSON-Schema code generation is deferred; the enum-parity canary partially mitigates dual-contract drift risk.

## Slice History

- Slice 0 - Scaffold: PROMOTED (controller gate passed; pushed to `origin/main`)

## Amendments

- 2026-06-12: Project renamed from Context Engine (`context-engine`) to Packwright (`packwright`) under specification amendment v1.0.1.

## Contract Clarifications

- S1.1: Resource stacks are capped at 20; high/medium-confidence packs require at least 8 resources, while low-confidence packs may contain 1-20.
- S1.1: `Resource.estMinutes` is an integer with a minimum value of 1.
- S1.1: TypeScript unions and JSON Schema enums remain dual contract sources. A parity canary covers stage, role, resource type, depth, and confidence; schema code generation is the deferred full fix.

## Standing Gate

- `npm audit` is required for this and all subsequent slice gates.
